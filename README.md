# Basic Drone API Code
 This repo, will introduce the fundamentals of drone stabilization.
## Getting Started
 In order to succeed with the implementation of the API, you'll have to follow the instructions below. To have a better understanding, I'd recommend reading the full article in which I explain the hole project building process. Any updates will be published in this repository, previous versions will be available to download just in case.

 I'd like to add that to take the most out of this project, it is recommended to take a look at the links below:
### Installing
 To install this source code, it is recommended to use VSCode + PlatformIO, since it is the IDE I use while it was being developed. There are many advantages but one I really like is the text highlighting that it implements while writing code. Follow this steps to get it done:

1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it, then, open it
2. Go to the extension menu at the left of the page and search for [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) the extension will be added below
3. Execute it and import the project for the Arduino UNO board

## Usage
 Connect your drone with the appropiate IMU orientation to your computer and ajust the code so that everything matches with it. Once you've done that the drone should be able to fly and balance itself. Because this is the first version of the code, it doesn't adapt to everyone's requirements thus allowing a future more sophisticated repo.
